# The phishing-rod project

## A little of the history.

After the pandemic, I needed to walk to get in shape, and to motivate myself, I decided to doÂ *Wardriving* and map the neighborhood networks. So, I walked around the block and found over 700 networks! Then, of course, I started collecting antennas and equipment.
In November, I'll lecture about *Wardriving, equipment and software* at *CPBR14*, and I wanted something cool and flashy to show, so I'm building this *cyberdeck* in the shape of a fishing rod. The top is an antenna, the bottom is a power bank, and the middle has cables that can be connected to the backpack and an M5 that serves as a control panel.

Why the fishing rod shape? Started with a big antenna and ended up earning that nickname.
